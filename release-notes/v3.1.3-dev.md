# Chief v3.1.3-dev Release Notes

## 🚀 What's New

### 🔧 Version v3.1.3-dev Development

- Ready for development work on v3.1.3-dev

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

#### Fixed Remote Plugins Update Process
- **Issue**: `chief.plugins_update` would create directory structure before validating git access, leading to orphaned directories when access failed
- **Impact**: Users with invalid repository URLs or access issues would get "directory already exists" errors on subsequent attempts
- **Solution**: 
  - Added git access validation **before** any filesystem changes using `git ls-remote`
  - Implemented automatic backup of existing local `~/chief_plugins` directories with timestamps
  - Reordered operations to validate → backup → create → clone for safer execution
- **Benefits**:
  - Early failure detection prevents orphaned directories
  - Local plugin work is automatically preserved with timestamped backups
  - Clear error messages guide users to resolve access issues
  - No more "directory already exists" clone failures
