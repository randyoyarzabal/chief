# Chief v3.1.2-dev Release Notes

## 🚀 What's New

### 🔧 Version v3.1.2-dev Development

- Ready for development work on v3.1.2-dev

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

#### Fixed Remote Plugins Update Process
- **Issue**: `chief.plugins_update` would create directory structure before validating git access, leading to orphaned directories when access failed
- **Impact**: Users with invalid repository URLs or access issues would get "directory already exists" errors on subsequent attempts
- **Solution**: 
  - Added git access validation **before** any filesystem changes using `git ls-remote`
  - Implemented automatic backup of existing local `~/chief_plugins` directories with timestamps
  - Reordered operations to validate → backup → create → clone for safer execution
- **Benefits**:
  - Early failure detection prevents orphaned directories
  - Local plugin work is automatically preserved with timestamped backups
  - Clear error messages guide users to resolve access issues
  - No more "directory already exists" clone failures

#### Fixed v3.1.1 Incomplete Implementation
- **Issue**: v3.1.1 incompletely implemented the naming convention standardization, breaking several functions
- **Root Cause**: v3.1.1 updated function definitions but missed updating the function calls
- **Impact**: `chief.bash_profile`, `chief.bashrc`, `chief.profile` failed with "command not found" errors
- **What v3.1.1 Did**: Updated function definitions (e.g., `chief.edit_file()` → `chief.edit-file()`)
- **What v3.1.1 Missed**: Function calls inside these functions still used old names (`chief.edit_file` calls)
- **v3.1.2 Fix**: Updated the missed function calls to use correct hyphen naming
- **Functions Restored**: `chief.bash_profile`, `chief.bashrc`, `chief.profile` now work correctly
