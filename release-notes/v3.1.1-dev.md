# Chief v3.1.1-dev Release Notes

## 🚀 What's New

### 🔧 Enhanced Version Management

- **Fixed `__chief.bump next-dev` validation** - Now properly accepts `-dev` version suffixes
- **Optional target version support** - Use `__chief.bump next-dev v3.1.1` to specify custom target version
- **Integrated test validation** - Tests must pass before releases can proceed
- **Context-aware completion messages** - Different instructions for development vs release workflows
- **Version-specific release notes** - Each version gets its own dedicated release notes file
- **Improved branch targeting** - Push instructions now use appropriate branch context

### 🛡️ Enhanced Safety & Quality

- **Mandatory test validation for releases** - `__chief.bump release` requires all tests to pass
- **Emergency override available** - `--skip-tests` option for critical situations (strongly discouraged)
- **Workflow optimization** - `next-dev` skips tests since it follows a successful release cycle
- **Clear test feedback** - Detailed output showing which tests passed/failed

### 📝 Enhanced User Experience

- **Comprehensive bug reporting guidance** - Main help and documentation now include clear instructions for reporting issues
- **OS and version detection** - Help system automatically shows user's OS and Chief version for easier issue reporting
- **GitHub issue link integration** - Direct links to create issues with proper templates
- **Historical preservation** - Restored v3.0 and v3.1.0 release notes that were accidentally lost during restructure

## 📋 Upgrade Notes

### For Developers

- **Enhanced flexibility** - Choose specific patch/minor versions for development cycles
- **Better workflow guidance** - Clear next steps for both development and release phases
- **Streamlined versioning** - No more validation errors when working with development versions
- **Quality assurance** - All releases now require passing tests, improving reliability
- **Test-driven releases** - Fix any failing tests before attempting `__chief.bump release`
- **Emergency override** - Use `--skip-tests` only in critical situations where tests can't be fixed immediately
