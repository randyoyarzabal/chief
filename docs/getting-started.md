  - `oc` command must be in PATH
  - Used for OpenShift cluster operations and authentication
  - If not installed, OpenShift functions will show helpful error messages

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety First

### Safe for Everyone

- **üöÄ Zero Disruption** - Only affects Bash, won't interfere with existing setups
- **üõ°Ô∏è Safe for Zsh Users** - Chief only affects your Bash shell environment
- **üí° Custom Prompts Safe** - Prompt customizations are disabled by default
- **üîÑ Easy Removal** - Clean uninstall available anytime

### Compatibility Notes

> **üõ°Ô∏è Safe for Zsh Users:** Chief only affects your Bash shell environment. If you're currently using Zsh, Oh My Zsh, or any other shell, Chief won't interfere with your existing setup. It only activates when you explicitly run `bash` or switch to a Bash session.

> **üí° Using Oh My Bash or Custom Prompts?** Chief's prompt customizations are **disabled by default** (`CHIEF_CFG_PROMPT=false`). If you have Oh My Bash, Starship, or other prompt tools, keep this setting disabled to avoid conflicts.

## ‚ö° Quick Start Tutorial

### 1. Verify Installation

After restarting your terminal:

```bash
# Check Chief is loaded
chief.help

# See your current configuration
chief.config_show
```

### 2. Explore Basic Commands

```bash
# Get help for any command
chief.help search

# Find where functions are defined
chief.whereis git_status

# List all available plugins
chief.plugin -?
```

### 3. Create Your First Plugin

```bash
# Create a custom plugin
chief.plugin mytools

# This opens your plugin file in your default editor
# Add some custom functions, save, and exit
```

Example plugin content:
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# My custom tools

# Quick directory navigation
alias ll='ls -la'
alias ..='cd ..'

# Custom function
my_status() {
    echo "System: $(uname -s)"
    echo "User: $(whoami)"
    echo "Directory: $(pwd)"
}
```

### 4. Test Your Plugin

```bash
# After saving your plugin, reload Chief
chief.reload

# Your new function is now available
my_status

# Find where it's defined
chief.whereis my_status
```

### 5. Enable Git Prompts (Optional)

```bash
# Enable beautiful git-aware prompts
chief.config_set PROMPT true

# Reload to see changes
chief.reload
```

## ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Upgrading Chief

### Automatic Update (Recommended)

```bash
# Update Chief with automatic config reconciliation
chief.config_update                   # Updates config with new options
chief.config_update --dry-run         # Preview changes before applying
```

### Manual Reinstall

```bash
# Reinstall over existing installation
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/randyoyarzabal/chief/refs/heads/main/tools/install.sh)"
```

### Branch Tracking

Chief supports tracking any valid Git branch for updates:

```bash
# Track stable releases (default)
chief.config_set update_branch main

# Track development features (‚ö†Ô∏è use with caution)  
chief.config_set update_branch dev

# Update to your configured branch
chief.update
```

**What `chief.config_update` does:**

- ‚úÖ **Adds new features** - Automatically adds new configuration options
- ‚úÖ **Handles renames** - Seamlessly migrates renamed variables
- ‚úÖ **Preserves customizations** - Keeps all your existing settings
- ‚úÖ **Creates backup** - Makes timestamped backup before changes
- ‚úÖ **Validates syntax** - Ensures new config is valid before applying

## üóëÔ∏è Uninstalling Chief

### Quick Uninstall

```bash
# Method 1: Using Chief command (easiest if Chief is working)
chief.uninstall

# Method 2: One-liner (works from anywhere)
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/randyoyarzabal/chief/refs/heads/main/tools/uninstall.sh)"
```

### What Happens During Uninstall

- ‚úÖ **Installation directory** (`~/.chief`) is completely removed
- ‚úÖ **Configuration file** is backed up as `~/.chief_config.sh.backup` then removed
- ‚úÖ **Shell configuration** (`~/.bash_profile`) is cleaned up automatically
- ‚úÖ **Environment variables** are removed from shell
