# Getting Started
1. Make a copy a config template from the 'templates' directory. Note that it need to be placed outside the root of Chief.

    ```bash
    cp templates/chief_config_template.sh ~/.chief_config.sh
    ```
   Change the configuration to suit. Be sure that the file/dir defined in 'CHIEF_USER_PLUGIN_DEFAULT'
   exists (i.e. $> touch $CHIEF_USER_PLUGIN_DEFAULT)

2. Define the following variables and source call in your start-up script (.bash_profile for example).

    For example:
    
    ```bash
    # Chief Environment
    CHIEF_CONFIG="$HOME/.chief_config.sh"                                                                                                          
    CHIEF_PATH="$HOME/dev/repos/github/chief"
    source ${CHIEF_PATH}/chief.sh
    ```
3. That's it. You're ready to use Chief! Restart your terminal.

4. Experiment and try the following commands:
    - `chief.[tab]` to see available built-in commands.
    - `chief.config` to edit your config.
    - `chief.bash_profile` to edit your bash start-up file.
    - `chief.plugin [user plug-in name]` to edit a user plugin. 
    - `chief.plugin` to edit the default user plugin.
